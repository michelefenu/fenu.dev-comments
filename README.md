# fenu.dev-comments

**fenu.dev-comments** is a repository that integrates [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) to handle blog comments using GitHub issues. This lightweight, open source comments widget leverages GitHub issues for blog comments, wiki pages, and more, providing a secure, privacy-friendly alternative to traditional commenting systems.

## Features

- **GitHub Issues as Data Store:** Comments are stored as GitHub issues, ensuring that your data is always accessible and under your control.
- **Privacy First:** No tracking or ads â€“ utterances remains completely free and private.
- **Lightweight & Fast:** Built with vanilla TypeScript, utterances is optimized for performance without unnecessary bloat.
- **Ease of Integration:** Automatically creates a GitHub issue when a comment is posted, simplifying the setup process.
- **Theming:** Styled with [Primer CSS](https://primer.style/), including support for a dark theme.

## How It Works

When the utterances widget loads on your blog, it uses the GitHub issue search API to:

1. **Identify the Associated Issue:** It searches for an issue that matches the current page based on `url`, `pathname`, or `title`.
2. **Automatic Issue Creation:** If no matching issue is found, the [utterances bot](https://utteranc.es/) will automatically create one when someone leaves a comment.
3. **Commenting Process:** Users can comment using GitHub OAuth for authorization, or directly on the GitHub issue page if they prefer.
